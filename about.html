<p>Hi, I'm Natalie Jiang.</p>

<p>I’m a full stack software developer dedicated to leveraging technology to build a better tomorrow. Whether it’s creating technology that powers a platform to create meaningful connections, discover live experiences, or help people live healthier lives, being a developer fuels my inquisitive nature to learn and gives me a creative outlet to implement the appropriate technologies for the challenges at hand. I thrive in collaborative environments, especially when solving complex problems. I’m able to build the bridge between technical and non-technical parties.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me hanging out with my dogs or on the slopes.</p>
