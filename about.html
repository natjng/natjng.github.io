<p>Hi, I'm Natalie Jiang.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a full stack developer dedicated to leveraging technology to solve tough problems that enable us to create meaningful connections and experiences. Being a developer fuels my inquisitive nature and gives me a creative outlet to implement the appropriate technologies for the challenges at hand. I thrive in cross-functional and collaborative environments. I'm a connector that's able to build the bridge between technical and non-technical parties.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me hanging out with my dogs, discovering new music, or on the slopes.</p>
