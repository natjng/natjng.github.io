I studied public health in college with the intent to pursue a career in health sciences. After spending some time in the healthcare setting, I felt that it wasn’t for me. I didn’t get the sense of fulfillment I was expecting.

In search for my passion and career, I learned more about coding. I took a few introductory courses, and it solidified my interest and showed me how much I enjoy coding. I enjoy programming because it challenges me to think critically and problem solve, while giving me a creative outlet. There is usually more than one way to solve a problem with code. 

More importantly, I believe that learning to code empowers me to build the world I want to see. I hope to use this new skill to take part in creating a future that is inclusive and unbiased. Ultimately, my goal is to build things that improve lives or things that just make people happy. :)
