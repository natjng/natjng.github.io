For my second coding project, I created a simple Content Management System (CMS), Wedding Registry, to keep track of registry items. 

I used the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm to organize my application and separate concerns. Active Record was used as my ORM framework to create a database, manage database schema, create associations between my models, retrieve data from my database, and more.
